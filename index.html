			<div class="pastor"><p>Pastor Juanita Julia is a passionate woman of God. Meeting her even once and you are drawn to that same passion. Originally from Detroit, MI Pastor Juanita knew early on that she loved church and she loved God. More importantly she knew that God loved her and has literally committed her life to him from a very early age. She was known to pray for all her family members even having some adult family members so convinced that she had a direct line with God that they would solicit her prayers even as a young child.</p>
 
		<p>She has been in some sort of leadership role since she was just 17 years old and now serves as the Founder and President of “The Center for Health and Wellness in Las Vegas, NV and the proud Pastor of Christ the King Christian Fellowship also located in Las Vegas. After 23 years in Leadership Pastor Juanita decided to walk by faith into what she believes is the call of God on her life by moving into full time ministry.</p>

		<p>Pastor Juanita has experience in radio and TV through her two different talk shows, <q>Life Coach Through the Bible</q> and <q>D.I.V.A’s for Christ Radio</q> as well as <q>Balanced Life Today</q> featured on the CW. Her biggest and most notable accomplishment is the birth of her three children Tyler (21), Madisyn (18) and Marshall (17). All three are active in ministry along side their Mother serving on the praise team, media ministry and children’s ministries.</p>

		<p>Pastor Juanita is a formally educated woman holding various degrees in Religion, Christian Ministries, Psychology and Ethics, Leadership and Biblical Counseling. Her degrees span from AA to PhD.</p>

			<p>Pastor Juanita preaches the gospel with authority and conviction. She believes her mandate is to preach the gospel with such clarity that people are moved into real life altering change. Along with strong and authentic praise and worship she is moving her congregation into the areas of discipleship and fellowship as top priorities for the year. Her favorite scripture is out of the book of 2 Corinthians 4:8-9 “We are hard pressed on every side, but not crushed; perplexed, but not in despair; persecuted, but not abandoned; struck down, but not destroyed.</p>
